            This privacy policy (<strong>&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;</strong>) governs how we, C² Community Services, Inc. (<strong>&quot;C²&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;we&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;our&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;us&quot;</strong>), use Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of: (i) the website <a href="https://c2tenants.com/">https://c2tenants.com/</a>, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, <strong>&quot;Site&quot;</strong>); and (ii) the C² landlords’ platform accessible on a software-as-a-service via the Site (together with its content and services, <strong>&quot;Platform&quot;</strong>).

          <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph--dark-grey">
            We do not ourselves host any of the Services. All hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below), as further described in this Privacy Policy, is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US).

            <li>
              <strong>Introduction.</strong> We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us.

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Terms.</strong> This Privacy Policy forms part of our Website and Platform Terms and Conditions Terms and Conditions, available at: <a href="https://c2tenants.com/terms">https://c2tenants.com/terms</a> and which you accepted prior to accessing and/or using the Platform for the first time (<strong>&quot;Terms&quot;</strong>). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Consent and Modification.</strong> You are not legally obligated to provide us with Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that providing us with Personal Information is of your own free will. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services or any part thereof. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such change will be effective 10 days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept such change. You should check from time to time and see whether any modification or change has been made to this Privacy Policy.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.</strong> We receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in connection with your use of the Services in the following ways:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Account</span>. In order to use the Platform, you will be required to create an account (<strong>&quot;Account&quot;</strong>). If you create an Account you will be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address, phone number, physical address, as well as a password that you will use for your Account (<strong>&quot;Account Information&quot;</strong>). You may also choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of the Account registration process and in connection with your ongoing use of your Account. We may send you a text message to your mobile phone or an e-mail to the e-mail address you submit to confirm your registration. If you choose not to create an Account, you may not be able to access or use certain features of the Platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">&quot;Contact Us&quot; Information</span>. If you send us a &quot;Contact Us&quot; request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address and phone number, and you may also choose to provide us with certain optional information, such as your company name.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Invite User Services</span>. The Platform may enable you to invite your staff members and residents to use our Platform and/or related mobile software application by using the Platform to send them an invitation email to their external email address (e.g., a Gmail address). If you send an invitation message we may collect Personal Information about the recipient such as their name, email address, phone number and date of birth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Payments</span>. The Platform includes the option to make payments to your suppliers, vendors and/or service providers in connection with your property. If you choose to make a payment via the Platform, we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the payment. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We use a tool called &quot;Stripe&quot; to process payments and transactions via the Platform on our behalf, which may collect information from you, including Personal Information, or require you to create a Stripe account, in connection with your payments. Stripe’s ability to use and share information collected by Stripe is governed by the Stripe Connect Platform Agreement, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/connect/legal" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/connect/legal</a> and Stripe’s Privacy Policy, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>. You hereby agree to review and be bound by the Stripe Connect Platform Agreement and Stripe’s Privacy Policy and authorize C² to provide your Personal Information to Stripe and Stripe to collect Personal Information from you in connection with any payments you make via the Platform and/or your Stripe account.
                </li>

                  <span class="highlight">Web Beacons / GIFs</span>. We may use in connection with the Services third party tracking technology companies which employ a software technology called ‘clear gifs’ (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</span>.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Google Analytics</span>. The Services may use a tool called &quot;Google Analytics&quot; to collect information about use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">Tracking Technologies</span>.
