            <strong>C² Privacy Policy for App</strong><br />This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs how we, C² Community Services, Inc. (“C²”, “we”, “our” or “us”), use Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of the C² Community Residents mobile software application (“App”).<br />We do not ourselves host any of the App. All hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below), as further described in this Privacy Policy, is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US).
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph--dark-grey">
            <strong>• Introduction</strong><br />We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the App. “Personal Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph--dark-grey">
            <strong>• EULA</strong><br />This Privacy Policy forms part of our App’s End User License Agreement which can be viewed from within the App and which you accepted prior to downloading, installing and/or using the App for the first time  (“EULA”). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the EULA.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph--dark-grey">
            <strong>• Consent and Modification</strong><br />You are not legally obligated to provide us with Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that providing us with Personal Information is of your own free will. By using the App, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the App. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such change will be effective 10 days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy in the App, and your continued use of the App thereafter means that you accept such change. You should check from time to time and see whether any modification or change has been made to this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph--dark-grey">
            <strong>• What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It</strong><br />We receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in connection with your use of the App in the following ways:<br />
            <strong>• Account</strong><br />In order to use the App, you will be required to create an account (“Account”). If you create an Account you will be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address, phone number, physical address, date of birth, as well as a password that you will use for your Account (“Account Information”). You may also choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of the Account registration process and in connection with your ongoing use of your Account, such as your selected payment method to make payment via the App. We may send you a text message to your mobile phone or an e-mail to the e-mail address you submit to confirm your registration. If you choose not to create an Account, you may not be able to access or use certain features of the App.<br />
            <strong>• “Contact Us” Information</strong><br />If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name, email address and phone number, and you may also choose to provide us with certain optional information, such as your company name.<br />
            <strong>• Location Data</strong><br />We may provide certain location-based services (“Location Services”) in connection with the App that are dependent on data related to the geographic location of your mobile device on which the App is installed (“Location Data”). If you choose to participate in these Location Services, you agree that we may collect or obtain your Location Data. You should be able to use the settings on your mobile device to turn off location-sharing features.<br />
            <strong>• Payments</strong><br />The App includes the option to make payments to your landlord or property management company. If you choose to make a payment via the App, we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and/or related bank account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the payment. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We use a tool called “Stripe” to process payments and transactions via the App on our behalf, which may collect information from you, including Personal Information, or require you to create a Stripe account, in connection with your payments. Stripe’s ability to use and share information collected by Stripe is governed by the Stripe Connect Platform Agreement, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/connect/legal" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/connect/legal</a> and Stripe’s Privacy Policy, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.

            <strong>• Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong><br />Our App may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order to for us to provide our App and present you with information that is customized for you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the App. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user.<br />
            <strong>• Mobile Device Data</strong><br />We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the App. Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device ID, and date and time stamps of App use.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.

These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images and scripts to help them better manage their content on our App. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our users’ personally identifiable information.<br />
